# Resonant Collinearity

Today was a fun challenge! Reading the description and understanding the challenge took some time and after reading it my initial solution direction was grid! As they say, when you have a hammer everything looks like a nail. But this time after thinking "grid", I had a second thought. It is presented in a grid but that doesn't mean a grid is the best way to go about it. All that matters is grouping the antenna positions per frequency. So, instead of reusing my grid I wrote something to group the locations per frequency and work from there.

Having all the locations per frequency meant finding antinodes was a matter of checking all permutations of location pairs. Per pair find out what their distance is to each other and check if moving that distance away from each location still gave a valid location. This seemed again a good use case for a `Set`. I could just add locations to it and leave it to the `Set` to remove duplicates.

What I did per frequency, I also did over all the frequencies. For every set of locations for a new frequency I reused the `Set` with locations already found. This gave me a set of unique locations. It turned out to be fast too, less than 1ms to find the solution to part 1.

Part 2 looked like more of the same so I started with copying my solution for part 1 and figured I'd make modifications as needed. My first idea was to see if I could calculate how many antinodes a start antenna would create. I wasted some time on this before I remembered I needed to count unique locations so calculating was useless. I settled on calculating the distance between a pair of antennas and start by keep adding the distance to the first antenna until it went out of bounds. Than I had to do the reverse, keep subtracting the distance from the first antenna until it went out of bounds. Low and behold, this worked on the first try!

I enjoyed the challenges. They seemed difficult at first but as I delved into the problem it became clear quite quickly how to solve them.

Rating: **Easy**

## Challenge description

### Part One

You find yourselves on the *roof* of a top-secret Easter Bunny installation.

While The Historians do their thing, you take a look at the familiar **huge antenna**. Much to your surprise, it seems to have been reconfigured to emit a signal that makes people 0.1% more likely to buy Easter Bunny brand Imitation Mediocre Chocolate as a Christmas gift! Unthinkable!

Scanning across the city, you find that there are actually many such antennas. Each antenna is tuned to a specific **frequency** indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific **antinodes** based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas. In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.

So, for these two antennas with frequency `a`, they create the two antinodes marked with `#`:

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

Adding a third antenna with the same frequency creates several more antinodes. It would ideally add four antinodes, but two are off the right side of the map, so instead it adds only two:

```
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......#...
..........
..........
```

Antennas with different frequencies don't create antinodes; `A` and `a` count as different frequencies. However, antinodes **can** occur at locations that contain antennas. In this diagram, the lone antenna with frequency capital `A` creates no antinodes but has a lowercase-`a`-frequency antinode at its location:

```
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......A...
..........
..........
```

The first example has antennas with two different frequencies, so the antinodes they create look like this, plus an antinode overlapping the topmost `A`-frequency antenna:

```
......#....#
...#....0...
....#0....#.
..#....0....
....0....#..
.#....A.....
...#........
#......#....
........A...
.........A..
..........#.
..........#.
```

Because the topmost `A`-frequency antenna overlaps with a `0`-frequency antinode, there are **`14`** total unique locations that contain an antinode within the bounds of the map.

Calculate the impact of the signal. **How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?**


### Part Two

Watching over your shoulder as you work, one of The Historians asks if you took the effects of resonant harmonics into your calculations.

Whoops!

After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at **any grid position** exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance. This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency).

So, these three `T`-frequency antennas now create many antinodes:

```
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........
```

In fact, the three `T`-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two antennas, so they are all also antinodes! This brings the total number of antinodes in the above example to **`9`**.

The original example now has **`34`** antinodes, including the antinodes that appear on every antenna:

```
##....#....#
.#.#....0...
..#.#0....#.
..##...0....
....0....#..
.#...#A....#
...#..#.....
#....#.#....
..#.....A...
....#....A..
.#........#.
...#......##
```

Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model. **How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?**
